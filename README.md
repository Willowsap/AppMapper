This program maps the Appstate.edu domain.

To use it, run python mapper.py
You can customize the mapper.py program to produce different outputs.
By default it creates a json file to be displayed in the accompanying web page and a folder named map which contains a file for each url containing the list of links in that url.

The links in the headers and footers of the pages are removed as they clutter the network map and do not provide any useful information.

The program also outputs a file called errors.txt which shows which webpages produces errors and what errors were produced. To view the current version of the webpage without running it yourself, visit https://student2.cs.appstate.edu/sapphirewe/AppMapper/

The map in the webpage is still going through a refinement process as network mapping softwares can be difficult to work with. Thank you for your patience.
